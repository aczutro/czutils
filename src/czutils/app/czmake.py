    """
    Reads a plain list of shell commands either from file or from sys.stdin
    and creates a 'Makefile' in which each command is an individual target.

    All targets are invoked by the 'all' target, so a call to "make [all]" will
    execute all commands and create an individual log file for each command.
    The 'Makefile' is formulated such that a second call to "make" will execute
    only the commands that failed the first time.

    The 'Makefile' also includes a 'clean' target that will remove the original
    input file, the 'Makefile' itself, and all the log files.

    Each input line is interpreted as an individual command.
    Lines starting with # are regarded as comments.

    :param inputFile: Path to file containing shell commands.
                      If it is None, reads from sys.stdin.
    :param targetDir: Path to directory where target and log files are to be
                      stored.  If a file or directory with that name already
                      exists, raises CZMakeError.
    :param overwrite: If true, overwrites file 'Makefile' silently.
                        If false and 'Makefile' already exists,
                      raises CZMakeError.
                        Does not apply to 'targetDir'.
    :param preserve:  If true, preserves input file, i.e. 'make clean' will not
                      delete it.

    :returns: 0 on success.

    :raises: CZMakeError
    :raises: czmake does NOT catch exceptions raised by OS-interacting functions
             like os.mkdir or io.open.
